May 05, 2019

## Motivation: 
1. Why do people need this product?
* Journalists need an application to alert other journalist, and the general public, when they are in danger while exercising their right of freedom of speech (via our application to Twitter and Facebook).

2. How can it help people?
* 

3. Which single action do you want your users to accomplish through the product?
* The website will periodically remove journalist via CRUD (who were not found within a specific amount of time), if a concerned person would like to repost a missing journalist they will be able to do so.

## MVC Outline
1. Who is the user?


2. What is the end goal of the user?


3. What actions does the user need to take to reach and acheive their end goal?

* When user posts a missing person they need to upload a photo, gender, name, age, location, and important information about the missing person (using the main section element).
* On the top webpage we want to post photos of missing persons (using the Carousel package) which will redirect to tell more about the person.
* On the right of the form in the main section we want a search a bar, and a image to be blown up of the person, along with their information. 
* When the user searches the database we will include a function to catches if a person has already been submitted before.
* We want to have an option to scratch out found persons instead of deleting them from the database.

1. Navbar
