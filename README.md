# Proposal
* When someone posts a missing person they need to upload a photo, gender, name, age, location, and important information about the missing person (using the main section element).
* On the top webpage we want to post photos of missing persons (using the Carousel package) which will redirect to tell more about the person.
* On the right of the form in the main section we want a search a bar, and a image to be blown up of the person, along with their information. 
* When the user searches the database we will include a function to catches if a person has already been submitted before.
* We want to have an option to scratch out found persons instead of deleting them from the database.

# Concept
* Providing an application to better secure the safety of activists' and journalists' freedom and safety.
* To let as many people know as possible about the missing person by connecting via social medias.

# Motivation 
* To provide an outlet for government accountability, media coverage, and safety for at risk individuals participating in civil disobedience.
* After documentary watching a documentary on several missing persons (who were journalist or activists)  a common denominator was found: all persons lost contact with their loved ones at some-pointâ€”and often times their family members could not provide clear information to to the authorities.
